# DiabetesDecisionTreeRandomForest

1.	Build a decision tree classifier:
- Import diabetes datasets
- Split it into X and Y
- Split X and Y into 70% training set and 30% testing set
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Make Predictions
- Calculate its accuracy

2.	Build a random tree classifier:
	- Import diabetes datasets
- Split it into X and Y
- Split X and Y into 70% training set and 30% testing set
- Train a Random Forest Classifier
- Make Predictions
- Caclulate its accuracy
